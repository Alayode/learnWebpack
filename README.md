This is a repo on using webpack based on the webpack tutorial by LearnCode.academy. 



Webpack has quickly become one of the most popular choices among web developer build tools. It can quickly build, minify, split & do a whole wonder of other things to your code.

In this webpack tutorial, I'm going to cover a very basic configuration for webpack that will get you started in a project. It will build all of your Javascript and minify and dedupe the code for production. To code react, we just have a little more configuration to add to our webpack config. That will have a full HTML, CSS, JS react application going.

Another great build tool is Browserify, which at the beginning of the process works a LOT like Webpack, but in the end, Webpack is a lot more featureful.
